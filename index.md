## A Deep Dive Into the Drug and Narcotics Related Crimes in San Fransisco

San Fransisco saw a peak in total number of drug and naroctics related crimes reports after the financial crisis in and during 2007-2008. The financial crisis ruined a lot of peoples financial situations which presumably lead to an increase in certain criminal behaviour, narcotics crimes being one of them. The city has since them recovered and as of 2017, has decreased the incident rate by 50% from the peak during 2007-2008. The below illustrated plot shows how drug and narcotics crime incidents (i.e. the amount of reported narcotics related crimes) has evolved as a function of time.

Evidently narcotics related crimes were significantly high even before the peak during 2007-2008, and has then seen a rapid decrease to an all time low incident rate by 2017. This rapid decrease in incident reports are likely caused by actions taken by the SF police department to combat these developments. 

Geographically, it is evident that the Mission, Southern and Tenderloin police districts saw the highest increase and subsequent decrease in drug related police reports, Tenderloin being the most volatile. This geographical development is illustrated in the below animation.

Evidently the narcotics incident rates seem to be very geographically correlated and is centered at and around the city center in Tenderloin police district. If we normalise by district size, it is perhaps even more noticable that Tenderloin police district is overly represented in terms of narcotics crimes.
