## A "Deep" Dive Into the Drug and Narcotics Related Crimes in San Fransisco

San Fransisco saw a peak in total number of drug and naroctics related crimes reports after the financial crisis in and during 2007-2008. The financial crisis ruined a lot of peoples financial situations which presumably lead to an increase in certain criminal behaviour, narcotics crimes being one of them. A [paper](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/GIVAS_Final_Report.pdf) written by the United Nations Offices of Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) highlighted that economic factors play a significant role in the prevailance of criminality. They too underline that there was a large increase in criminality that coinsides with the financial crisis. The city has since them recovered and as of 2017, has decreased the incident rate by 50% from the peak during 2007-2008. The below illustrated plot shows how drug and narcotics crime incidents (i.e. the amount of reported narcotics related crimes) has evolved as a function of time.

*Time series plot showing the temporal development of the total number of drug and narctics related police reports*

Evidently narcotics related crimes were significantly high even before the peak during 2007-2008, and has then seen a rapid decrease to an all time low incident rate by 2017. This rapid decrease in incident reports are likely caused by actions taken by the SF police department to combat these developments. 

Geographically, it is evident that the Mission, Southern and Tenderloin police districts saw the highest increase and subsequent decrease in drug related police reports, Tenderloin being the most volatile. This geographical development is illustrated in the below animation.

*Geographical heatmap showing the total amount of drug and narcotics related police reports have been filed in each policing district, and how this grographical distribution as evolved over time*

Evidently the narcotics incident rates seem to be very geographically correlated and is centered at and around the city center in Tenderloin police district. If we normalise by district size, it is perhaps even more noticable that Tenderloin police district is overly represented in terms of narcotics crimes. However, this effect can be driven by two vastly different factors: Either those specific police districts saw a real increase in drug use and therefore also a natural increase in police reportings as a result, or that the drug use has been relatively stable over the years, but the policing force presence has just increased in the those specific regions which would also lead to more police reports as a consequence.

*Interactive plot visualising the total amount of drug and narcotics related police reports that have been filed in a given hour of the day for each available year*

The above interactive plot that shows where, temporally within a day, most of the drug and narcotics related police fillings have been reported. Notably the increase during 2007-2008 saw big increase in police reports during and around midday and late afternoon. Infact, most of the variance in the year to year number of reports seem to stem from this particular period within a day. Once more, this could indicate a larger and more thorough police presence during that time or that the increase stems from the fact that more people were openly abusing drugs during the midday and late afternoon. The latter could be explained by the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis which increased unemployment rates and homelessness, both of which could explain an incrase in midday drug use. It could also be argued that the increased police presence that could presumably also explain the tendecies, would have expensive and likely not something that would have been seriously suggested following the aftermath of the financial crisis.
