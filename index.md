## Deadly Roads

Globally, 1.35 million people are killed on roadways every year which means that almost almost 3,700 people are killed every single day. The Association for Safe International Road Travel (ASIRT) reports that traffic related injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged 5 to 29. In addition to the devastation and loss of life, traffic accidents also cuase considerable financial losses to the individuals and families involved. Due to the lost productivity, time taken off by family members etc, the average country looses 3 percent of their GDP due to traffic related accidents. 

This online magazine will dive deeper into traffic accindents that cause death and injury, in NYC from 2013 to 2022. We aim to investigate hopsital coverage and figure out whether the distance to the hospitals play a role in the deadliness of the accidents, and model optimal new locations for hosptials in NYC.
